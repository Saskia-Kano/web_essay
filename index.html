	<p>Saul Bass was an American graphic designer from New York. He was born in 8th May 1920 and died 25th April 1996. While he was working during the mid-20th century, graphic design was just on the upswing. Throughout this era, he would have been considered one of the single most accomplished and celebrated designers in the world. He had also helped shape post-war visual culture.</p>
	
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>From a young age, Bass was known to be creative as he drew constantly. As a schoolboy, he had a passionate interest for the visual world. With his ability to adapt and transform, visual elements that caught his eye, to fulfil his creative needs, he showed clear traits of a true designer. He had also spent a lot of time in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, looking at special exhibitions. The works he favoured most out of the Museum were the artefacts from Egypt and other ancient civilisations. To prepare for his career in graphic design, he then went on to study at the Manhattan’s Art Students’ League taking night classes as a teenager in New York, where he became a scholarship student. He then worked as a freelance designer after leaving the Manhattan’s Art Students’ League. In 1938, Bass went on to work for Warner Brothers as a ‘lettering and paste-up man’ for $20 a week. He then left his job at Warner Brothers to work for Twentieth Century Fox. Soon after he was fortunate enough to be taught by Gyorgy Kepes in Brooklyn College (from 1944 to 1945), who became a big shaping influence for Bass. Kepes was a Hungarian designer, photographer, painter, theorist, and Bauhaus devotee. Kepes had focused Bass’ ideas on the topics of modernism, psychology, and the social responsibility of designers. Kepes had proved to be the mentor Bass was looking for. Bass had later said, “He really just set me on fire”, emphasising how much inspiration Kepes gave to Bass.</p>
